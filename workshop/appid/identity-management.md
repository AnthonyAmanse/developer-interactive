# Identity Management

## What is App ID?

IBM CloudÂ® App ID allows you to easily add authentication to web and mobile apps with zero code changes and no redeploy required. You no longer have to worry about setting up infrastructure for identity, ensuring geo-availability, and confirming compliance regulations. Instead, enhance your apps with advanced security capabilities, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO) and user-defined password policies. You can also use App ID's scalable user registry to let users manage their own accounts.
